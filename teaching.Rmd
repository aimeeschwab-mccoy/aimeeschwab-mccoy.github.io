### Online course resources

- __MTH 361__: Probability and Statistics in the Health Sciences
- __MTH 362__: Statistical Modeling
- __MTH 366__: Machine Learning

All courses were taught online due to the pandemic. MTH 361 used a flipped classroom approach, and recordings of my lecture videos on [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/aimeeds2005). MTH 362 and MTH 366 were synchronous online courses.

Selected course material is also available on [Github](https://github.com/aimeeschwab-mccoy).
