Hi! My name is Aimee Schwab-McCoy and I'm a professional educator and writer in data science and statistics. After seven years in academia, I am now a Data Science Content Developer (not the YouTube kind...). I create and support interactive learning resources at zyBooks, an online textbook company, for data science, machine learning, and statistics. We've got some awesome new releases coming soon that I can't wait to share with everyone!

I am also a certified RStudio Instructor, and an active researcher in statistics and data science education and curriculum development. 

My research interests include:

- Statistics education, especially including teaching and learning of biostatistics, data visualization, advanced modeling
- Data science education and curriculum development
- Spatial statistics and generalized linear mixed models in R
- Statistical consulting

My non-research interests include:

- 👨‍👩‍👦 Adventures with my son Link and husband Max
- 🏞️ Gardening and spending time outdoors
- 🎮 Gaming (especially Nintendo + PC)
- 📚 Reading
